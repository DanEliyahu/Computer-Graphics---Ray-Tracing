Part 4/ Refractions
Implementation of intersectPlaneCheckered:
    We begin be checking if we've hit the plane as before and as seen in the TA.
    Then we need to figure out which material we've hit, based on the hit point coordinates.
    We know that the plane is axis aligned, meaning its' normal has non-zero in one of it's coordinates,
    and zero in the other two. This way we can transfer to "UV-space" coordinates to simulate
    the checkerboard. Now we reduce the problem to a 1x1 square in which the diagonal is black.
    We can notice that if both 0 < u,v < 0.5, or 0.5 < u,v < 1, subtracting 0.5 from both of them
    and then multiplying will give a positive/zero result, meaning we now that the material should
    be m1. In the other cases, for example when 0 < u < 0.5 and 0.5 < v < 1, subtracting 0.5
    and multiplying will result in a negative number, so the material is m2.
    Applying this to negative numbers using the sign function, and the fractional value of 
    the coordinates we get the desired result.

In this exercise we only used TA slides.
